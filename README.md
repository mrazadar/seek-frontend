## Note:

This test application uses `react-boilerplate` for project configuration. Please check its documentation for any concept. 

I tried to complete the task as much as I could with the time constraints I had. I hope this give the basic idea of my skills. 

## Quick start

1. Clone this repo
2. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd seek-frontend`.<br />
3. Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
   *We auto-detect `yarn` for installing packages by default, if you wish to force `npm` usage do: `USE_YARN=false npm run setup`*<br />
   *At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.*
